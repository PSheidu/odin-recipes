        <h2>Tasty Jollof Rice Recipe</h2>
        <p>Spiced and stewed in a flavorful tomato broth, 
            it is everything from "everyday" to celebration. 
            The classic version is cooked with long-grain rice 
            (Uncle Ben's/Carolina's) and seasoned with 
            Nigerian-style curry powder and dried thyme. 
            Served with fried, ripe plantains which we 
            call dodo and coleslaw, it is everything. 
            Note that the world might consider this a side but in Nigeria, 
            it is the main.</p>

        <p>Even more special is Party Rice, a smoky version, 
            cooked over an open fire, layered with smoke, spice, 
            and immeasurable goodness. A few years ago, 
            I cracked the code on approximating the smoky flavor on the stovetop. 
            The secret? Read on.</p>

            <p>Learning to make Jollof was a rite of passage 
                for me and I've gone through so many iterations 
                each time trying to streamline the process while 
                delivering the most flavour.</p>

                <h3>Steps</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet 
                        peppers in a food processor or blender for about 
                        45 seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</li>

                    <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. 
                        Once the oil is heated add the onions you set aside 
                        and fry just until they turn golden brown. 
                        Once the onions, have turned brown in color add 
                        the tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. 
                        Then add the blended tomato mixture 
                        (reserve about 1/4 cup and set aside) and 
                        fry the mixture with the onions and tomato 
                        paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir 
                        consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>

                    <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, 
                        and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your 
                        seasonings (salt, curry powder, thyme, all 
                        purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). 
                        Continue to boil for 10 minutes.</li>

                    <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. 
                        Mix it very well with the tomato stew. 
                        At this point if you need to add water so that 
                        the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken 
                        stock go ahead and do so. Add the bay leaves, 
                        cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat 
                        for 15-30 minutes.</li>

                    <li>When the liquid has almost dried up 
                        add the remaining tomato stew, cover, 
                        and let it cook for another 5-10 minutes 
                        heat until the liquid has completely dried up. 
                        Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your Jollof 
                        Rice is ready to be eaten!</li>
