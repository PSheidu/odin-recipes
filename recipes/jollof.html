        <h2>Tasty Jollof Rice Recipe</h2>
        <p>Spiced and stewed in a flavorful tomato broth, 
            it is everything from "everyday" to celebration. 
            The classic version is cooked with long-grain rice 
            (Uncle Ben's/Carolina's) and seasoned with 
            Nigerian-style curry powder and dried thyme. 
            Served with fried, ripe plantains which we 
            call dodo and coleslaw, it is everything. 
            Note that the world might consider this a side but in Nigeria, 
            it is the main.</p>

        <p>Even more special is Party Rice, a smoky version, 
            cooked over an open fire, layered with smoke, spice, 
            and immeasurable goodness. A few years ago, 
            I cracked the code on approximating the smoky flavor on the stovetop. 
            The secret? Read on.</p>

            <p>Learning to make Jollof was a rite of passage 
                for me and I've gone through so many iterations 
                each time trying to streamline the process while 
                delivering the most flavour.</p>
