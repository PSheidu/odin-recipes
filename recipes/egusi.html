        <h2>Egusi Soup Recipe</h2>
        <p>Egusi Soup is a finger-licking good Nigerian 
            soup made with a white variety of pumpkin seeds. 
            It is spicy, nutty with exotic African flavors!</p>
        <p>Egusi soup is also one of the most popular soups, 
            if not the most popular for all Nigerians and 
            non-Nigerians that like Nigerian fufu recipes.
            The recipe detailed on this page is what 
            I call the Caking Method of cooking Egusi 
            Soup (the Egusi Before Oil method).</p>

            <h3>Egusi Soup Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ground melon</li>
                <li>Smoked turkey</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>Beef stock cubes</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Palm oil</li>
                <li>Vegetables</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Add ground melon to a bowl, add about a cup 
                    of water and mix to form a paste then set aside. 
                    Wash and chop the spinach, drain in a 
                    colander and set aside.</li>
                <li>Place a big pan on medium heat, add palm oil 
                    and heat for about 3 minutes (Do not bleach oil) 
                    add the reserved chopped onions and 
                    Sautee till translucent</li>
                <li>Add pepper mix, locust beans and stir to combine. 
                    Bring to boil for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the egusi paste in bits to pepper, 
                    reduce the heat, do not stir and cover the pot with a lid. 
                    Cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the lid, and gently stir the soup. 
                    The egusi would be lumpy at this point, use 
                    the back of a ladle to break the lumps it 
                    into desired size/texture</li>
                <li>Add smoked turkey, ground crayfish and 
                    crayfish, beef stock (if using) and stir 
                    to combine. Add bouillon cubes, taste and 
                    adjust accordingly. I did not add salt to this 
                    soup as the smoked turkey and mackerel already 
                    contained salt. Continue to cook for another 
                    10 minutes, check at intervals and stir to avoid 
                    burning if need be</li>
                <li>Add shredded smoked mackerel and gently 
                    stir into the soup. Add chopped spinach, 
                    stir to combine and cook for another 3 to 
                    5 minutes. Take it off the heat, allow to cool 
                    for about 10 minutes before serving</li>
            </ol>
